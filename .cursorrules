# Project Rules

## After Every Code Change

After completing code changes, always run the following checks to verify the code compiles and passes linting:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will run TypeScript compilation and catch any type errors or build issues.

If the project has separate lint/tsc commands, also run:
- `npm run lint` (if available)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` (for type checking without emitting files)
